# Proof-of-Concept
Case study on the obesity problem in Santa Clara County.

As a Project Manager for this study, a Proof of concept was made to propose fitness application to solve the obesity problem. 
In a word document backed by research I was able to explain why my fitness application is needed to fix this problem. I was able to explain the business side of process of making the application. These were the business objectives of the application, the risks and limitations, the timeline of the creation, the comparison to other fitness apps, and the features that the app will have. 

Included in the document are a creation backlog and screenshots of survey questions and polls that were collected for data, a gnatt chart to show how the work will be planned and scheduled out during creation, and an excel spreadsheet showing which features and work will be done during the sprints. The BeFit application user interface was built using Adobe XD wireframes to show the business of how the application will look like and the features displayed.
